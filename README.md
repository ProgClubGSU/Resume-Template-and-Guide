# Writing an Amazing Resume 

> This guide compiles the best resume practices to get into these tech roles we're all aiming for - even with no prior experience.

## 🤔 Does my resume even matter that much? 
Your resume is the **biggest asset** in your job search! Before any interview, referral, or offer - it needs to get past the recruiter screen and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
- It's asymmetric: a few hours of focused resume work can unlock dozens of interview opporunities.
- To anyone in this space we're breaking in, your resume is often the first impression, so lets make it count

# Resume Structure Overview
Let's look at this logically, recruiters are spending 6-12 seconds skimming through your resume. We read words in general from Top to Bottom then Left to Right. Right? 
So we should order by relevancy/importance in the same way! (not what's chronological)
Here is the ordering

1. **Work Experience**  -- this goes below education if you're applying to internship roles!
2. **Education** 
3. **Skills**
4. **Projects**
5. **Coursework**
6. **Leadership / Clubs**
7. **Awards Certifications**

> *If you're applying for internship, keep Education at the tippity top! ET intern recruiters care about your school, GPA and the fact you're a student still. When you graduate and have more work experiences, that's when experience takes precedence
> If you've interned at a FAANG company, lead with that

# Back to the Basics - Baby Steps

## 🧢 Resume Header: Your Name + Links
The header of your resume should immediately tell the recruiter who you are and how to reach you — **clean, aligned, and professional.**

### ✅ What to Include (all on 1-2 LINES if possible):

- **Full Name** (large, bold)
- **Email**
- **Phone number** (U.S. only)
- **GitHub**
- **LinkedIn**
- **Portfolio or Personal Website** *(if relevant and have actualy activity)*
- **Citizenship Status** (e.g. U.S. Citizen, if applicable and you have an ethnic name like mine "YAOHUI ZHANG" )


❌ Common Mistakes
- using .edu email, especially when you don't check it
- not putting linkedin, recruiters actually look at this
- full mailing address is OBSOLETE
- Don't hyperlink, just in case

## 🎓 Resume Education Section

Your **Education** section should be compact, clean, and front-loaded with the most important info — especially if you're applying for internships.

### What to include

- **University name**
- Location only if you're applying to local roles
- **Degree + Major** (optional minor but usually not important)
- **Expected graduation date** recruiters need to confirm this!!!
- **GPA** (only if at least 3.5+)
- Relevant Course work: Data Structure, Algorithms, Software Engineering (these are important ones)
- Honors or awards ( also honors college) If nothing important put extracurriculars or leadership instead

> Formatting Rule: Keep this to 2–3 lines max. It should never take up more than vertical space than your biggest project.

**Nice! now we got the basics down...**

# 🧈 Before We Move On... Let's Talk Bullet Points (Your Bread & Butter)

Before we dive into Work Experience and Projects — we **have to** master bullet points.

Why? Because they’re the **core of your resume**. This is where 90% of your technical signal comes from.

Bad bullet points = mid resume.  
Strong bullet points = resume that sounds like it came from a legit SWE internship.

So let’s break it down.

**EVERY. SINGLE. BULLET.** should follow the XYZ method. 
Don't just describe what you did — explain why it mattered.

### The XYZ Formula:
**Accomplished [X] by doing [Y], resulting in [Z}**

> This is how we write high-signal, ATS-optimized bullets. Be concrete. Be quantifiable. Be technical.

#### ❌ Bad Example:
Made a multiplayer typing game using React and Socket.IO.

#### ✅ Good Example:
**Developed** a real-time multiplayer typing simulator using React and WebSockets, **to support** 50+ concurrent users with <50ms latency and persistent session states, **resulting in** 3,000+ matches played in the first month.

> _Developed a thing using these technologies to solve a problem, enabling a measurable impact._

### **WAIT!** Let's take a step back and see what we did here:
- Always **start with a strong TECHNICAL action verb** (Developed, Engineered, Optimized, etc.)
- Include a **technical feature** and with what technologies
- Mention **why it mattered** and a **concrete result** (reduced latency by x, improved x performance by x, etc.)
- Use **NUMBERS** whereever possible 0 event estimated ones
  
>💡 Stuck? write a messy brain-dump of what you did, then reverse-engineer a clean XYZ bullet from that.

🎯 The goal: Make you resume/bullet points sound like it COULD'VE come from someone who just finished an internship at a startup or big tech
> I don't care if you built it solo at 3AM

### ✅ Bullet Point Self-Check

- [ ] Does it start with a technical action verb?
- [ ] Does it name at least one tool/tech?
- [ ] Does it show *why* that feature mattered?
- [ ] Does it include a number or result?

Here's a good example, third bullet point has a variation for the context of this specific experience

# 💼 Work Experience Section
Now we can get to the most important section on your resume, whether if you've had internships, freelance gigs, reseaerch, or even technical volunteer roles
Even if you haven’t worked at a big company, you can still make this section look like a **real engineering resume** by writing strong technical bullets.

## What to Include

For each entry, include:

- **Position Title** (use a technical title: e.g., *Software Engineering Intern*, not “IT Helper”)
- **Company/Organization Name**
- **MAYBE Location** (City, State) — only if you're applying to local roles (you can have two resumes handy, one with and another without)
- **Start & End Dates** (Month Year – Month Year or "Present")
- 3–4 **high-signal bullet points** written using the **XYZ Formula**

### Upgrading that title
If your official title is generic or unimpressive, **upgrade it** to something both accurate but more technical 
We really gotta sell ourselves without capping too hard.

| Original Title        | Better Version              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| “Intern”              | Software Engineering Intern |
| “Volunteer Web Dev”   | Web Developer               |
| “Research Assistant”  | Computer Science Researcher |
| “IT Assistant”        | Backend Developer           |

#### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Writing vague bullets like “Helped with codebase” or “Worked with React”
- ❌ No technologies mentioned in the bullets
- ❌ No outcome or result — just task descriptions
- ❌ Repeating the same action verb across bullets
- ❌ Having 5+ bullets or giant one-liners (3–4 is the sweet spot)

#### Make sure to:
- Use job listings on LinkedIn as inspiration for phrasing
- If you're working on a long-term project, **write about it like it’s a job**
- If you’ve done open source or group projects, list them here if they were organized like a team role

**TLDR: Your bullets shouldn’t sound like a student describing what they learned — they should sound like an engineer describing what they shipped.**

# 🛠️ Projects Section
Projects are **your proof of work** — they show you can build, ship, and solve problems even without formal experience.

This section can easily carry your resume *if you do it right*. **Treat every project like it’s a startup feature — not a school assignment.**

> Most recruiters on non-technical they will skim this section really hard, but it starts to matter more when the resume gets passed to the hiring manager or a technical team member.


![Project Example](images/project%20example.png)

## ✅ What to Include Per Project

- **Project Name** (bold or standout)
- 1-line tech stack summary *(React, Node.js, Firestore, etc.)*
- 3–4 high-quality **multi-line bullets** using the XYZ method
- GitHub/demo link if available

## 🎯 Project Writing Rules

- **Use strong action verbs** (Designed, Engineered, Integrated, etc.)
- **Be technical** — no “made a website” or “did a project”
- **Always include metrics** (users, latency, performance, etc.)
- Include **backend details** or architecture if you have them
- Each bullet should communicate:
  - What you built
  - Why it matters
  - What tech was involved
  - What results it achieved
 
## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ “Built a personal website using HTML/CSS” ← low signal
- ❌ Listing projects without bullets
- ❌ Repeating the same verbs like “Made,” “Created,” “Used”
- ❌ Not mentioning technologies
- ❌ No measurable impact or result

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Think like a product engineer: What problem were you solving? Who used it? What tech decision did you make and why?
- If it’s a class project — reframe it like a real product
- Use **secure backend, real-time sync, scalable architecture, seed-based PRNG, REST/GraphQL APIs, stateless scaling, etc.** wherever you can truthfully defend it
