# Writing an Amazing Resume 

> This guide compiles the best resume practices to get into these tech roles we're all aiming for - even with no prior experience.

## 🤔 Does my resume even matter that much? 
Your resume is the **biggest asset** in your job search! Before any interview, referral, or offer - it needs to get past the recruiter screen and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
- It's asymmetric: a few hours of focused resume work can unlock dozens of interview opporunities.
- To anyone in this space we're breaking in, your resume is often the first impression, so lets make it count

# Resume Structure Overview
Let's look at this logically, recruiters are spending 6-12 seconds skimming through your resume. We read words in general from Top to Bottom then Left to Right. Right? 
So we should order by relevancy/importance in the same way! (not what's chronological)
Here is the ordering

1. **Work Experience**  -- this goes below education if you're applying to internship roles!
2. **Education** 
3. **Skills**
4. **Projects**
5. **Coursework**
6. **Leadership / Clubs**
7. **Awards Certifications**

> *If you're applying for internship, keep Education at the tippity top! ET intern recruiters care about your school, GPA and the fact you're a student still. When you graduate and have more work experiences, that's when experience takes precedence
> If you've interned at a FAANG company, lead with that

# Back to the Basics - Baby Steps

## 🧢 Resume Header: Your Name + Links
The header of your resume should immediately tell the recruiter who you are and how to reach you — **clean, aligned, and professional.**

### ✅ What to Include (all on 1-2 LINES if possible):

- **Full Name** (large, bold)
- **Email**
- **Phone number** (U.S. only)
- **GitHub**
- **LinkedIn**
- **Portfolio or Personal Website** *(if relevant and have actualy activity)*
- **Citizenship Status** (e.g. U.S. Citizen, if applicable and you have an ethnic name like mine "YAOHUI ZHANG" )


❌ Common Mistakes
- using .edu email, especially when you don't check it
- not putting linkedin, recruiters actually look at this
- full mailing address is OBSOLETE
- Don't hyperlink, just in case

## 🎓 Resume Education Section

Your **Education** section should be compact, clean, and front-loaded with the most important info — especially if you're applying for internships.

### What to include

- **University name**
- Location only if you're applying to local roles
- **Degree + Major** (optional minor but usually not important)
- **Expected graduation date** recruiters need to confirm this!!!
- **GPA** (only if at least 3.5+)
- Relevant Course work: Data Structure, Algorithms, Software Engineering (these are important ones)
- Honors or awards ( also honors college) If nothing important put extracurriculars or leadership instead

> Formatting Rule: Keep this to 2–3 lines max. It should never take up more than vertical space than your biggest project.

**Nice! now we got the basics down...**

# Resume Writing Formula

**EVERY. SINGLE. BULLET.** should follow the XYZ method. 
Don't just describe what you did — explain why it mattered.

### The XYZ Formula:
**Accomplished [X] by doing [Y], resulting in [Z}**

> This is how we write high-signal, ATS-optimized bullets. Be concrete. Be quantifiable. Be technical.

> ### ❌ Bad Example:
> Made a multiplayer typing game using React and Socket.IO.

### ✅ Good Example:
> **Developed** a real-time multiplayer typing simulator using React and WebSockets, **to support** 50+ concurrent users with <50ms latency and persistent session states, **resulting in** 3,000+ matches played in the first month.

> _Developed a thing using these technologies to solve a problem, enabling a measurable impact._

**WAIT!** Let's take a step back and see what we did here:
- Always **start with a strong TECHNICAL action verb** (Developed, Engineered, Optimized, etc.)
- Include a **technical feature** and with what technologies
- Mention **why it mattered** and a **concrete result** (reduced latency by x, improved x performance by x, etc.)
- Use **NUMBERS** whereever possible 0 event estimated ones
  
>💡 Stuck? write a messy brain-dump of what you did, then reverse-engineer a clean XYZ bullet from that.

🎯 The goal: Make you resume/bullet points sound like it COULD'VE come from someone who just finished an internship at a startup or big tech
> I don't care if you built it solo at 3AM
