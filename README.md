# ✨ Writing an Amazing Resume 

> This guide compiles the best resume practices to get into these tech roles we're all aiming for — even with no prior experience.

## 🤔 Does my resume even matter that much?

Your resume is the **biggest asset** in your job search!

Before any interview, referral, or offer — it needs to get past the recruiter screen and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

- It's asymmetric: a few hours of focused resume work can unlock dozens of interview opportunities.
- In this space we're breaking into, your resume is often the first impression — so let’s make it count.

---

# 🧱 Resume Structure Overview

Recruiters skim resumes in 6–12 seconds. Top to bottom. Left to right.

So we structure by **relevance**, not **chronology**:

1. **Work Experience** — put *below* Education if you're applying to internships
2. **Education**
3. **Skills**
4. **Projects**
5. **Coursework**
6. **Leadership / Clubs**
7. **Awards / Certifications**

> 💡 *If you're applying for internships, keep Education at the top. Intern recruiters care most about your school, GPA, and that you're a current student. If you've interned at a FAANG company, lead with that!*

---

# 👣 Back to the Basics — Baby Steps

---

## 🧢 Resume Header: Your Name + Links

The header should **immediately tell the recruiter who you are and how to reach you**.

### ✅ What to include (on 1–2 lines max):

- **Full Name** (large, bold)
- **Email**
- **Phone number** (U.S. only)
- **GitHub**
- **LinkedIn**
- **Portfolio/Website** *(if relevant and active)*
- **Citizenship status** (especially useful if you have a non-Western name)

### ❌ Common Mistakes

- Using `.edu` email (especially if you don't check it)
- Not linking LinkedIn — recruiters actually click this!
- Including your full mailing address (obsolete)
- Hyperlinking text (just show the raw URL)

---

## 🎓 Education Section

Your **Education** section should be compact, clean, and front-loaded with the most important info — especially for internships.

### ✅ What to include:

- **University name**
- **City/State** *(optional unless applying local)*
- **Degree + Major** (Minor is optional)
- **Expected graduation date** (critical!)
- **GPA** (if 3.5+)
- **Relevant coursework**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, etc.
- **Honors/Awards** (or leadership if none)

> 🔎 Keep this to **2–3 lines max**. It should never take up more vertical space than your biggest project.

# 🧈 Before We Move On... Let's Talk Bullet Points (Your Bread & Butter)

Bullet points are **90% of your technical signal**.

Bad bullet points = mid resume  
Strong bullet points = legit internship-level resume

### 🎯 The XYZ Formula

**Accomplished [X] by doing [Y], resulting in [Z]**

> This is how we write high-signal, ATS-optimized bullets. Be concrete. Be quantifiable. Be technical.

---

#### ❌ Bad Example:
Made a multiplayer typing game using React and Socket.IO.

#### ✅ Good Example:
**Developed** a real-time multiplayer typing simulator using React and WebSockets, **to support** 50+ concurrent users with <50ms latency and persistent session states, **resulting in** 3,000+ matches played in the first month.

---

### 📋 Bullet Point Guidelines

- Start with a strong **technical action verb** (Developed, Engineered, Optimized)
- Include a **feature** + **tech used**
- Explain **why it mattered**
- Include **results or metrics** if possible

> 💡 Stuck? Brain-dump what you did. Then rewrite it with the XYZ structure.

### ✅ Bullet Point Self-Check

- [ ] Does it start with a technical action verb?
- [ ] Does it name at least one tool/tech?
- [ ] Does it show *why* that feature mattered?
- [ ] Does it include a number or result?

# 💼 Work Experience Section

This is your **core section** if you’ve had internships, freelance gigs, research, or even volunteer engineering work.

Even without big names on your resume, you can still make this section look like a legit engineer's — if your bullets are solid.

### ✅ What to Include:

- **Position title** (make it sound technical!)
- **Company/Org name**
- **Location** *(optional; use “Remote” if relevant)*
- **Start + End Dates**
- **3–4 bullets** using the XYZ method

---

### 🔧 Title Upgrades

| Original Title        | Better Version              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| “Intern”              | Software Engineering Intern |
| “Volunteer Web Dev”   | Web Developer               |
| “Research Assistant”  | Computer Science Researcher |
| “IT Assistant”        | Backend Developer           |

---

### ❌ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Vague bullets like “Helped with codebase”
- ❌ No tech/tools listed
- ❌ No outcomes or impact
- ❌ Using the same verb repeatedly
- ❌ 5+ bullets or one-line walls of text

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Use LinkedIn job listings as inspiration
- Write long-term personal projects like jobs
- Open source = valid experience if team-based

**TLDR**: Don’t write like a student learning — write like an engineer shipping.

---

# 🛠️ Projects Section

Projects are your **proof of work**.

Treat every project like a feature at a startup — not a class assignment.

> Most recruiters skim this, but hiring managers *read it closely*.

![Project Example](images/project%20example.png)

---

### ✅ What to include:

- **Project name**
- 1-line tech stack summary
- 3–4 bullets using XYZ
- GitHub/demo link

---

### 🎯 Project Writing Rules

- Use **strong action verbs**
- Include **tech stack**
- Explain **problem solved**
- Show **metrics/impact**

---

### ❌ Common Mistakes

- ❌ “Built a personal website using HTML/CSS”
- ❌ No bullets
- ❌ Generic verbs
- ❌ No tech
- ❌ No results

---

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Think like a product engineer: What problem? Who used it? What changed?
- Reframe class projects like real-world features
- Use phrases like:
  - *Secure backend*
  - *Real-time sync*
  - *Seed-based PRNG*
  - *Stateless scaling*
  - *GraphQL API*

---

# 🧠 Skills Section

This section helps **ATS match you** to job descriptions — and rounds out your technical profile.

> For internships: include most technologies you’ve touched *and can talk about*

---

### ✅ What to Include (in 2–3 lines max)

- Programming languages
- Frameworks/libraries
- Tools/platforms
- Databases/cloud

> ⚠️ Don’t label groups — mix by relevance and strength.

## ❌ Common Mistakes
- ❌ Putting “problem solving” or “communication” — this isn’t LinkedIn
- ❌ Alphabetizing or randomly ordering
